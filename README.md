#  Optimizing Feature Extraction with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)


##  Project Overview

This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to a high-dimensional medical dataset consisting of **10,000 patient records** and **50 features**. The goal is to reduce the number of variables while retaining the essential information that describes patient characteristics ‚Äî particularly behavioral and socioeconomic factors.


Dimensionality reduction helps uncover correlations between variables and identify the most influential components that explain variability across patient cases.
This is crucial for clinical research, cost prediction models, and strategic healthcare planning.
